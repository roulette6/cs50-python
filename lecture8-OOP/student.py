"""
the difference between varname and _varname is that
varname is the name of the property and _varname is
the name of the instance variable.

Unfortunately, Python doesn't prevent users from
manually setting instance variables b/c you're on
the honor system ðŸ˜¢
Don't manually set instance vars starting with _

class methods can be called without instantiating an
object first.
